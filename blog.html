        <h2>Welcome to My Official Website!</h2>
     <!-- November Post -->
      <article class="blog-post">
        <h2>New Gear, New Shows, New Community</h2>
        <p class="date">November 2025</p>

        <p>This month has felt like a turning point for me as an artist. I recently acquired a <strong>TC Helicon vocal and guitar effects pedal</strong>, and it has completely transformed my live sound. Having vocal effects and harmonies at my feet has made everything feel so much more depthful and professional-sounding. It’s one thing to hear those kinds of polished vocals in your head, and another to finally hear them coming out of the speakers while you’re performing. I feel more confident, more intentional, and more excited than ever about what my sets can be.</p>

        <p>November also brought one of my favorite shows I’ve done so far. I joined forces with <strong>EliSam</strong> for a night of acoustics and feminine energy at <strong>Shags Rock and Sports</strong>. Sharing the stage with two powerful, talented women made the entire evening feel really special. The vibe in the room was warm, supportive, and electric in its own soft way. It reminded me just how important it is to create spaces where women in music can lift each other up and shine together. We already have an even more exciting show in the works for <strong>January</strong>, and I can’t wait to share more details soon.</p>

        <p>This month I also attended my very first <strong>Huntsville Music Community Quarterly Meetup</strong>, and it was such an eye-opening experience. I learned a lot about the city’s music initiatives and how intentional Huntsville is about building a deep, diverse, and sustainable local music ecosystem. Hearing about their vision made me feel really hopeful about being an independent artist here. I’m hoping I can collaborate with the Huntsville Music Office and their community in the future, whether that’s through performances, programs, or other ways of supporting the scene.</p>

        <p>All of these moments—new gear, new collaborations, and new connections—have made November feel like a month of leveling up. I’m grateful for everyone who’s been following along, coming to shows, and supporting this journey. There’s a lot in the works for early 2026, and I’m excited to keep growing, experimenting, and sharing it all with you.</p>

        <p class="date">October 2025</p>

        <p>Hey everyone! I’m so excited to finally launch my official website. This has been something I’ve wanted to build for a long time, and seeing it come together feels surreal. Whether you’ve been following my journey for a while or you’re just discovering my music, I wanted to create a space where everything I do, whether it's performances, music, or updates can all live in one place.</p>

        <p>This website is more than just a portfolio. It’s part of my journey as a college student learning to grow both creatively and professionally. I’m studying <strong>Digital Audiences</strong> with a minor in <strong>Media Content Creation</strong> at ASU’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, and every piece of this site connects back to what I’m learning in class. From building a personal brand to designing pages and understanding how to reach audiences, this site is a living example of how I’m turning my education into something tangible.</p>

        <p>As an independent musician, I wear a lot of hats: performer, songwriter, social media manager, and sometimes even web developer. Creating this website gave me a chance to combine all of those roles into one project that truly represents who I am and where I’m headed. It’s a reminder that going to college isn’t just about preparing for a future career, it’s also about learning how to promote yourself, tell your story, and share what you love with the world.</p>

        <p>Thank you for checking out the site and supporting my music. I’ll be using this blog to share updates on upcoming shows, new releases, creative projects, and reflections on what I’m learning along the way. I can’t wait to see how this space grows from here.</p>
