        <h2>Welcome to My Official Website!</h2>
        <p class="date">October 2025</p>

        <p>Hey everyone! I’m so excited to finally launch my official website. This has been something I’ve wanted to build for a long time, and seeing it come together feels surreal. Whether you’ve been following my journey for a while or you’re just discovering my music, I wanted to create a space where everything I do, whether it's performances, music, or updates can all live in one place.</p>

        <p>This website is more than just a portfolio. It’s part of my journey as a college student learning to grow both creatively and professionally. I’m studying <strong>Digital Audiences</strong> with a minor in <strong>Media Content Creation</strong> at ASU’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, and every piece of this site connects back to what I’m learning in class. From building a personal brand to designing pages and understanding how to reach audiences, this site is a living example of how I’m turning my education into something tangible.</p>

        <p>As an independent musician, I wear a lot of hats: performer, songwriter, social media manager, and sometimes even web developer. Creating this website gave me a chance to combine all of those roles into one project that truly represents who I am and where I’m headed. It’s a reminder that going to college isn’t just about preparing for a future career, it’s also about learning how to promote yourself, tell your story, and share what you love with the world.</p>

        <p>Thank you for checking out the site and supporting my music. I’ll be using this blog to share updates on upcoming shows, new releases, creative projects, and reflections on what I’m learning along the way. I can’t wait to see how this space grows from here.</p>
